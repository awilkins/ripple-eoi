# Offline Working

The ability to work off a network is common in the healthcare domain.

A truly ubiquitous platform will not depend on a network connection for basic
utility.

## Replication

Replication of data into a local device silo permits use offline. Because
security depends on keys that are not stored on the device, security is not
compromised greatly.

When the device rejoins a network, any records added can be integrated with the
main silos of data seamlessly.

## Simplicity

Because all data in the system is able to be rendered human-readable without
access to networked resources, being offline is not a problem for continued
reference to patient records.
