# Overview

The proposal addresses platform considerations essential to the enterprise of
creating and maintaining medical records. These are concerns I have seen stated
over and over again in RFP requirements at multiple Healthcare IT companies.
They are seldom if ever addressed satisfactorily, in most implementations I have
been party to, most effort is concentrated on putting a functioning system in
front of users and these concerns remain secondary.

## What the proposal addresses

* [Audit](audit.md)
* [Data integrity](data-integrity.md)
  * And [data resilience](data-resilience.md)
* [Privacy and security](privacy-and-security.md)
* [Offline working](offline-working.md)
* Simplicity of system creation by [avoiding relational databases](relational-databases.md)
