# The Ubiquitous Platform

The ubiquitous platform is composed of two elements ;

* A universally available system for rendering content
* A universally available system for processing content

The former is browser technology. In particular, by utilising the  [Electron]()
application platform, a consistent platform would be available for all three
desktop major operating systems, in addition to the vast majority of tablet and
smart phone devices, most of which use the [WebKit]() browser engine in their
default browsers, thus ensuring consistency with the WebKit based Electron.

The latter is the human being! By ensuring all content is able to be rendered to
a human-readable document, we gain the simple advantage that paper notes have
had all along - you don't need special tools to read them. The primary purpose
of health records is communication between health professionals - even yourself,
a little later on. Communicating with computer systems is useful, as is being
able to process records automatically, but focussing on these goals at the
expense of the human clinician audience harms usability and adoption.
